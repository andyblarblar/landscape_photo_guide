# Dealing With Exposure

Because landscapes often feature elevation and natural lighting, having both a backlit subject and a subject in shadow is common. This can pose a challenge when determining a neutral exposure, as some areas of the image may be too bright or dark when other areas are correctly exposed. Thankfully, there are a few techniques that can help overcome this issue.

## Shooting in Raw

> **Note:** not all cameras have the ability to use the RAW format. If you are unsure of if your camera supports a raw format, please check the cameras manual, or consult the manufactures website for info. 


'Shooting in raw' refers to changing from using a compressed image format, such as JPEG or PNG, to one that preserves more of the cameras information. This is useful for our scenario, as it allows you to brighten or darken areas of the image using software such as Adobe Lightroom that may otherwise have been lost in a jpeg.

To use Raw photos, open your camera's central options menu and search for a 'Quality' submenu. This is often denoted by a large F (for *F*ine jpeg), or the icon of an SD card. 
Once you have located this menu, select an option denoted by RAW, or RAW + JPEG. This will configure your camera to use the RAW format from now on.

Raw photos give a sort of 'passive' benefit. So long as they are being used and processed in software, you will simply be able to brighten and darken the image more than before without any other effort.

## HDR

High Dynamic Range (HDR) is a technique that allows for obtaining a greater dynamic range in an image than is natively supported in the camera. It works by selectively merging areas from a sequence of separately exposed images to produce an image that contains properly exposed areas from each.

HDR itself is a software technique, so we will focus on obtaining the sequence of images themselves for now.

> **Note:** regardless of the method used, you will need to minimize shake when taking this sequence of photos. Because of this, it is best to use a tripod, although a sufficiently high shutter speed (high enough to cancel out the drift of your hand) will also work.

### Bracketing 

The easiest way to take this sequence of photos is using a function called bracketing, which is available in most cameras. Bracketing does exactly what you need to do - take a sequence of photos with varying exposure.

Bracketing functions differently on different camera models, so you will need to consult your cameras manual to enable its use.

When enabled, simply set a neutral exposure when setting up your photo. Next, simply activate the bracketing and shoot until the sequence is complete. From here, you can feed this sequence into an HDR processor when editing later.

### Manual Offseting

If you cannot use bracketing for whatever reason, then you will need to change exposure manually. 

A simple method to do this is as follows:

1. **Find a neutral exposure for the image.**
2. **Take a photo at this neutral exposure.** It's a good idea to [check your focus](./focusing.md) here, if you haven't done so already.
3. **Move the shutter speed up by a stop, and take a photo.** This should be darker than the original photo.
4. **Move the shutter speed down a stop from the neutral image, and take a photo.** This should be a bit brighter than the original photo.
4. **(Optional) Repeat the process with increasing stop distances to get more data.** This can allow for greater flexibility when editing, if desired.
