# Dealing With Motion

Landscape photography has to grapple with just as much motion as, say, a sporting photo. While perhaps unintuitive, this is because landscapes themselves are often under the effects of the environment, notably the wind. This means if not properly handled, shaking leaves, moving waves, or even shifting clouds can add unwanted motion blur to your image.

Unfortunately, there is often no way to eliminate these issues, as something like leaves simply move too much to account for. However, while this is the case generally, there still exists some guidelines to lessen the blow.

## Reducing Blur Using Exposure

As a general rule, it is best to keep your shutter speed and apature high to reduce both motion blur and focus blur. In a particularly windy environment however, it may be necessary to raise the shutter speed even further than normal. To do this, you have two options:

1. Raise the ISO and shutter speed by equal values.
2. Lower the apature and raise the shutter speed by equal values.

Neither of these two options are ideal, as they will reduce the overall quality of the image by introducing noise and blur respectively. However, in a windy environment, you may deem the trade-off worth it to reduce motion blur.

## Don't Use HDR In Moving Environments

While it may be tempting to use [HDR](./dealing_with_exposure.md) in all environments, the technique can be quite devastating in a moving environment. This is because during the image stacking process, HDR effectively merges the images. While this does allow for excellent dynamic range, this process *also merges blur*. In a windy environment, this would mean amplifying the motion blur by however many images are in the HDR sequence, massively increasing its effect. Because of this issue, it is best to avoid using HDR in moving environments.

## Work With the Motion!

Sometimes it's best, particularly when getting frustrated, to try to use motion blur in creative ways. While there's obviously no science to this, take a look at [it's section of the guide](./working_with_motion.md) for inspiration. Who knows, you may even get a better photo than you were imagining.
