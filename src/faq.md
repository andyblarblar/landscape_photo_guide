## Cameras are expensive. Can I just use my phone?

With camera phones getting increasingly better year by year, it's hard to deny that phone photography isn't possible. There are a few things to keep in mind before attempting to use a phone for something like landscape photography. First of all, many phones lack manual control, at least out of the box. Second, phone cameras are inherently non-interchangeable, and often purely a wide angle lens. Finally, the small sensor in phone cameras means that long exposures or low light photos are very difficult to pull off. 

This isn't to say you cannot use a phone for landscape photography, it's just going to be much more difficult, and often going to lower creative freedoms. Of course, the best camera is the one you have on you, so never feel bad about using your phone, so long as you're up for the challenge.

Most of this guide can still apply to phones, although you may need to look up workarounds to the lack of specific features.

## Landscapes are so cool, but I live in the middle of american suburbia! How can I find somewhere interesting?

I've found two ways to get around this issue. First, don't underestimate how nice even just a local park can look under interesting weather. I've gotten some of my best photos just walking around in fog. Second, check if there's a state park or recreation area within a reasonable driving distance. I've found that most people have at least one of these within an hours drive. While it may not be particularly spectacular, these parks will give a great practice opportunity for when you do get to go on a more extravagant trip.

## Wont it be hard to take landscapes without a variety of lenses?

While lens choice is very nice, landscape photography can be done with pretty much anything, so long as you work your composition around what equipment you have. For example, the kit zoom that comes with most cameras is versatile enough to handle all but distant and very close subjects. If you find yourself focusing on one of those niches, then it may be worth investing in a lens specialized for that niche. Until then though, don't stress about lens choice, just focus on taking photos.
