# Finding a Landscape

The most important piece of any landscape photo is the landscape itself. While an exhaustive guide to exotic locations is outside of the scope of this guide, a photo-friendly landscape tends to have the following properties:

- Interesting lighting, such as reflections or fog
- An identifiable foreground, subject, and background
- A good variety of colors 

As a beginner, it is best to try to head out on a sunny, non-windy day to ease the difficulty of the photography.
