# Dealing with focus

When taking a landscape photo, focus is very important. If it is off, then one of your fore, mid, or background will be blurry.

The following is a general algorithm for obtaining focus:

1. **Identify your fore, mid, and background.** You will be using these to check your focus later. 
2. **Focus on a point in your mid-ground.** This should be relatively centered in the photo for best results.
3. **Check if your fore and background are in focus.** This is best done with a test photo. If both are in focus, then you are done. You will tell if an area is out of focus by comparing the relative levels of blur between the area and the focus area chosen for step 2.
4. **Raise your apature by a stop.** This will widen your field of focus. After performing this step, your exposure will have changed, and will need to be accounted for. 
5. **Repeat 3 and 4 until either in focus, or you cannot raise the apature further.** If you have hit your apature limit, consider using a shorter lens to raise the depth of field.
