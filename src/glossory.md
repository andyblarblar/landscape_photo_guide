# Glossary of Definitions

- **Aperture** – A circular shutter that controls the amount of light let into the lens. A component of exposure, and the primary controller of depth of field.

- **DSLR** – A type of camera with an interchangeable lens, which uses optical reflections to provide an image to the viewfinder.

- **Exposure** – The level of light the camera received while taking a picture.
    - **Over-exposed** – An image that has received too much light.
    - **Under-exposed** – An image that has received too little light.
    - **Neutral Exposure** - An image that has received a balanced level of light, not over or under exposed. 

- **F-stop** – The units of aperture, in log scale. Smaller numbers indicate a wider opening, more light, and a shallower depth of field.

- **ISO** – The measure of gain applied to the sensor, in standardized units. The larger the ISO, the more exposed the image will be, and the more noise will be present.

- **Mirror-less** – A type of camera that has an interchangeable lens, but uses an electronic viewfinder.

- **Shutter** – The mechanism used by the camera to control when the sensor receives light. A component of exposure, and the primary controller of motion blur.

- **Shutter-speed** – The units of measure for shutter, in fractions of a second. The longer the shutter speed, the more light is let in to the camera, and the more motion blur the image will have.

- **Viewfinder** – The small window found on some cameras that allows for viewing the image seen by the camera. Can be electronic or optical.
