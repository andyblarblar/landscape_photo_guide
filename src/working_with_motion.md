# Working With Motion

The most breathtaking landscape photos are often those that utilise motion blur in dramatic ways. A classic example is a blurred waterfall, or smoothed ocean waves. Achieving this effect is reasonably easy, but does take some care to avoid making the whole image a blurry mess.

Using a low shutter speed is of course the key to getting blur in your image. While this is simple enough, here are a few tips to make it more consistent.

## Tip 1: Use a Tripod

Achieving the level of blur seen in these famous photos often necessitates the use of shutter speeds well in excess of 1s. Because of this, the use of a tripod is exceptionally helpful. At these low speeds, handholding is simply not an option, as the hand shake will be visible in the image. While you can try to simply place the camera on an object, this will likely lead to cumbersome angles and a mess if water is involved.

> **Note:** If you do not currently own a tripod, don't worry about going out and getting a fancy one. For the vast majority of people, cheap tripods are perfectly adequate. These can easily found at thrift shops or garage sales for under $10. 

## Tip 2: Use a Neutral Density (ND) Filter 

When rasing your shutter speed to very high values, you may notice your image getting very overexposed. While you can counteract this at small values by constraining your apature, this will likely not be enough to achieve a reasonable exposure. To solve this issue, you can use an ND filter, which is a screw on filter that simply darkens your image uniformly (a bit like unpolarized sunglasses). This will allow for lowering shutter speeds to extreme values while maintaining a neutral exposure.

> **Note:** When using a filter, make sure to note the size of your lenses filter thread. This is often printed on the tip of the lens with a âˆ… symbol. Only filters of this exact size will be usable with this lens.

## Tip 3: Image Stacking Blurs!

If for whatever reason the above two tips aren't feasible, there is an alternate technique that allows for the use of *any* shutter speed, while still getting blur. 

As mentioned in the [motion reduction section](./dealing_with_motion.md), merging a sequence of images also merges those images blur. This means that if you have enough images, you can emulate a longer shutter speed by merging a sequence of photos with a smaller one! This has a few main benefits:

- This can be used handheld, no tripod needed
- This can be done without filters, as you can simply use a neutral exposure
- The merging process can also be an HDR sequence, allowing for the use of both techniques at once, while also lowering noise in the process

The primary downside of this technique is simply the extra time and space it takes to edit these sequences of images, which can be quite substantial as you take longer exposures.

While there are a variety of ways to achieve this technique, the easiest is just to use HDR processors with a sequence of normal images. This will leave your process as follows:

1. **Ready your photo as described in the prior sections, optionally using bracketing for HDR**
2. **Set your camera to a continues drive mode**
3. **Take as many photos as is reasonable for storage.** The exact amount of photos in the sequence doesn't matter, but of course the more photos you have, the more blur you can apply. If using a high shutter speed, you should try to take more if possible. A good target for extreme blur is 20 images.
4. **Feed your sequence into an HDR processor.** Most software will simply merge your images even if you are not bracketing, achieving the desired blur effect.
